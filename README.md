# Simple Toastify Notifications

Simple Toastify Notifications is a Concrete CMS add-on that enhances the way feedback messages are displayed. Instead of using standard Bootstrap alert boxes or inline form messages, it shows success and error messages as modern, non-intrusive toast notifications using the Toastify.js library. The notifications appear temporarily, fade in and out smoothly, and keep the page layout clean and user-friendly. It works out of the box with default Concrete CMS forms and is lightweight, responsive, and easy to set up. This add-on is ideal for anyone who wants to improve the user experience of their website without major changes to their existing forms or templates.
